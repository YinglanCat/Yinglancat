- Current Role: **CTO of a startup (Hardware Direction)**

### 💼 What I Do
I live between two worlds:  
the world of **hardware**, where signals, impedance, and noise rule everything…  
and the world of **software**, where ideas become apps, APIs, and products.

**Hardware Engineering:**
- Analog circuit design  
- High-speed digital design (DDR, PCIe, SerDes, SI/PI analysis)  
- Embedded systems & board-level architecture  

**Software Engineering:**
- Web full-stack development (Frontend / Backend / Serverless)  
- IoT & industrial systems  
- Internal tools, automation, scripting

### 💻 Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
- C / C++  
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Golang  
- Python  
- Rust (currently learning)

**Areas of Focus:**  
- Hardware Design (Analog + High-Speed Digital)  
- Embedded Systems  
- Web Full-Stack  
- System Architecture  
- Automation & DevOps

### ✨ Philosophy
I build things because I enjoy seeing ideas turn into reality —  
whether that’s through a circuit, a waveform on an oscilloscope,  
or a piece of code running smoothly in production.
